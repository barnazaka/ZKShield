**ZKShield** is a website dApp built for NoirHack to champion privacy and inspire everyone to embrace it. Using Noir’s zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), it lets users protect their data, learn privacy skills, and join a community of Guardians—all in a simple, secure platform.

**What’s It About?**
Imagine controlling your personal info without oversharing. ZKShield makes this real:

**ZK Vault**: Safely store data like your birthdate and prove things (e.g., “I’m over 18”) without revealing details.
**Privacy Quests**: Fun tutorials teach you ZK magic and earn you badges, like “Guardian Novice.”
G**uardian Community**: Share privacy tips anonymously, building a movement to stay private and proud.

**Why ZKShield?**
Privacy matters, but it’s often ignored. ZKShield, built on the Sepolia testnet, makes it easy and exciting to take back control. It’s our way of supporting Aztec’s mission to make privacy universal, one Guardian at a time.
